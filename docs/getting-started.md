## Getting Started

Create a recipe file as `recipe.lua`, that is a configuration for assembling a server.

```lua
software_package "nginx" {
    action = "install",
}

service "nginx" {
    action = {"enable", "start"},
}
```
And then execute `cofu` command to apply a recipe to your machine.

```
$ sudo cofu recipe.lua
Starting cofu...
